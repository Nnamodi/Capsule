    <string name="note_body">\n
        The remora, a type of sucking fish, is able to attach itself firmly to other sea creatures and then detach itself with ease and without harming the host.\n\n
        The remora attaches itself to rays, sharks, turtles, whales, and other sea creatures, regardless of the texture of their skin or shell. The remora feeds on parasites and its hostâ€™s leftover foodâ€”all the while enjoying a free ride and protection from predators. Researchers are studying the remoraâ€™s sucker, or suction disc, to see how it enables the fish to attach itself gently but firmly to a variety of surfaces.\n\n
        The remoraâ€™s oval-shaped suction disc is located on the back of its head. The disc has a fleshy outer lip that forms a tight seal to maintain suction. Within the disc, rows of flaps have tiny, rigid spines. When the flaps are erect, the spines make contact with the hostâ€™s skin, creating friction. This combination of suction and friction keeps the remora firmly attached regardless of the hostâ€™s speed or sudden change in direction.</string>
